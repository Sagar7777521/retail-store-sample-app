# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for designing a comprehensive CI/CD workflow for the retail store sample application. The workflow should automate the process of detecting code changes, building Docker images, pushing them to Amazon ECR, and updating Helm chart values to enable GitOps-based deployments through ArgoCD.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want an automated CI/CD pipeline that detects changes in my microservices code, so that I don't have to manually build and deploy each service.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer pushes code changes to the main or develop branch THEN the system SHALL automatically detect which microservices have been modified
2. WHEN changes are detected in the src/ directory THEN the system SHALL trigger the CI/CD pipeline only for the affected services
3. WHEN no changes are detected in src/ directory THEN the system SHALL skip the build process to save resources
4. WHEN a pull request is created targeting the main branch THEN the system SHALL run validation builds without deploying

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want Docker images to be automatically built and pushed to ECR with proper tagging, so that I can maintain version control and traceability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code changes are detected for a service THEN the system SHALL build a Docker image using the service's Dockerfile
2. WHEN a Docker image is built THEN the system SHALL tag it with both the Git commit SHA and 'latest' tag
3. WHEN pushing to ECR THEN the system SHALL create the ECR repository if it doesn't exist
4. WHEN images are pushed THEN the system SHALL implement lifecycle policies to manage image retention
5. WHEN build fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and stop the pipeline

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a platform engineer, I want Helm chart values to be automatically updated with new image references, so that ArgoCD can sync the latest changes without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new images are successfully pushed to ECR THEN the system SHALL update the corresponding Helm chart values.yaml files
2. WHEN updating values.yaml THEN the system SHALL replace the image tag with the new commit SHA
3. WHEN updating values.yaml THEN the system SHALL update the repository URL to point to the private ECR registry
4. WHEN values are updated THEN the system SHALL commit the changes back to the repository with appropriate commit messages
5. WHEN committing changes THEN the system SHALL include [skip ci] in commit messages to prevent infinite loops

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want proper authentication and authorization for AWS services, so that the CI/CD pipeline operates securely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing AWS services THEN the system SHALL use IAM credentials stored as GitHub secrets
2. WHEN authenticating to ECR THEN the system SHALL use temporary tokens with appropriate permissions
3. WHEN creating ECR repositories THEN the system SHALL enable image scanning and encryption
4. WHEN managing secrets THEN the system SHALL never expose sensitive information in logs or outputs
5. WHEN accessing AWS resources THEN the system SHALL follow the principle of least privilege

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear feedback on the CI/CD pipeline status, so that I can quickly identify and resolve any issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the pipeline starts THEN the system SHALL provide clear status updates for each stage
2. WHEN builds succeed THEN the system SHALL notify about successful deployments and next steps
3. WHEN builds fail THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error messages and troubleshooting guidance
4. WHEN the pipeline completes THEN the system SHALL summarize what services were built and deployed
5. WHEN ArgoCD sync is expected THEN the system SHALL inform users about the automatic sync process

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a platform team, I want the CI/CD workflow to integrate seamlessly with our GitOps approach using ArgoCD, so that deployments are consistent and auditable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Helm values are updated THEN the system SHALL trigger ArgoCD to detect and sync changes
2. WHEN updating ArgoCD application manifests THEN the system SHALL maintain proper target revisions
3. WHEN changes are committed THEN the system SHALL provide full audit trail through Git history
4. WHEN multiple services are updated THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent updates without conflicts
5. WHEN sync fails THEN ArgoCD SHALL provide visibility into deployment status and errors

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As an operations engineer, I want infrastructure components like ECR repositories to be managed as code, so that I can maintain consistency across environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying infrastructure THEN the system SHALL create ECR repositories using Terraform
2. WHEN managing ECR repositories THEN the system SHALL apply consistent tagging and lifecycle policies
3. WHEN infrastructure changes THEN the system SHALL support plan, apply, and destroy operations
4. WHEN managing multiple environments THEN the system SHALL support environment-specific configurations
5. WHEN infrastructure deployment fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear rollback procedures

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the ability to customize the CI/CD workflow for different scenarios, so that I can adapt it to various deployment strategies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN different environments are targeted THEN the system SHALL support configurable AWS regions and account IDs
2. WHEN custom tagging strategies are needed THEN the system SHALL allow modification of image tag formats
3. WHEN new services are added THEN the system SHALL easily accommodate additional microservices
4. WHEN different branches are used THEN the system SHALL support branch-specific deployment strategies
5. WHEN manual intervention is needed THEN the system SHALL provide workflow dispatch options for manual triggers
